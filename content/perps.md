DeFi perpetuals are decentralized derivatives that enable traders to speculate on cryptocurrency prices with leverage without expiration dates. Unlike traditional futures, perpetuals use funding mechanisms to maintain price convergence with spot markets. These protocols operate on smart contracts, eliminating the need for centralized intermediaries and providing permissionless access to leveraged trading across multiple blockchain networks.
