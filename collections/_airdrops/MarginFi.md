- We advise to deposit at least \$1000.
- You can use looping(supply-borrow-supply) to maximize your points. Watch your leverage and don't borrow against volatile assets.
- You can stake \$SOL using Marginfi liquid staking protocol as well (likely they will count this towards future airdrop as well).
