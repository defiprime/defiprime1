Decentralized perpetual futures (perps) trading platforms have surged in popularity, offering traders the ability to speculate on asset prices with leverage, without expiration dates, and in a non-custodial manner. Hyperliquid has emerged as a dominant player in this space, but new platforms like Extended Exchange, Lighter, and Ostium are carving out their own niches with unique features and value propositions. In this blog post, we’ll dive deep into a comparison of these four platforms, analyzing their features, strengths, weaknesses, and potential for traders. Whether you’re a seasoned DeFi trader or a curious newcomer, this guide will help you navigate these innovative platforms.

## Hyperliquid: The King of Perp DEXs

![](/images/blog/perps/image1.png)

**Overview**

[Hyperliquid](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/DEFIPRIME) is the leading decentralized perpetual futures exchange, boasting over $4.7 billion in 24-hour trading volume and a 70% share of the on-chain perps market. Built on its own Layer 1 blockchain with the HyperBFT consensus mechanism, Hyperliquid offers a seamless, centralized exchange (CEX)-like experience with the benefits of decentralization. Its native token, $HYPE, powers governance and incentivizes community participation.

**Key Features**

- **Liquidity and Volume**: Hyperliquid processes \$3–4 billion in daily trading volume, rivaling CEXs like Binance for major assets like BTC, ETH, and SOL. It supports over 130 assets with up to 50x leverage.
- **Zero Gas Fees**: Transactions on Hyperliquid’s L1 chain incur no gas fees, with maker rebates of 0.2% and taker fees starting at 0.05%, making it cost-efficient for high-frequency traders.
- **HLP Vault**: The Hyperliquid Liquidity Pool (HLP) vault, with a TVL of over \$391 million and a 36% APR, allows users to deposit USDC and earn a share of platform fees. Users can also create their own vaults with as little as 100 USDC, earning 10% profit share.
- **On-Chain Order Book**: Unlike many DEXs that rely on off-chain order books, Hyperliquid’s fully on-chain order book ensures transparency and low slippage, even in volatile markets.
- **Advanced Trading Tools**: Features include one-click trading, stop-loss/take-profit orders, and integration with TradingView for advanced charting.
- **Community-Driven**: Hyperliquid’s airdrop of \$HYPE tokens was one of the largest in crypto history, rewarding active traders and fostering a strong community.

**Strengths**

- Unmatched liquidity and trading volume make it the go-to platform for both retail and institutional traders.
- Zero gas fees and low trading fees enhance cost efficiency.
- The HLP vault offers a passive income stream with high returns.
- Rapid listing of new tokens, including memecoins like PURR and GOAT, attracts speculative traders.
- Non-custodial and globally accessible with no KYC requirements.

**Weaknesses**

- Limited multi-chain support; deposits are restricted to USDC via Arbitrum, which may be a hurdle for users on other networks.
- The platform’s complexity and high leverage (up to 50x) may overwhelm beginners.
- The HLP vault’s net short strategy carries risks, as seen in a \$4 million loss due to a memecoin trading algorithm manipulation.

**Why Hyperliquid Stands Out**

Hyperliquid’s combination of high liquidity, zero gas fees, and a CEX-like user experience makes it the gold standard for perp trading. Its ability to list new tokens quickly and its robust ecosystem (including tools like HypurrScan and HypurrFun) give it a significant edge. For traders looking for a reliable, high-performance platform, Hyperliquid is hard to beat.

## Extended Exchange: TradFi Meets DeFi

![](/images/blog/perps/image3.png)

**Overview**

[Extended Exchange](https://app.extended.exchange/join/DEFIPRIME), founded by former Revolut team members, is a newer entrant aiming to bridge traditional finance (TradFi) and DeFi. It recently launched a points campaign to incentivize early adopters, offering access to markets like gold (XAU) and the S&P 500 (SPX). The platform is still in its early stages but shows promise for traders interested in diversified asset exposure.

**Key Features**

- **TradFi Markets**: Extended Exchange allows trading of synthetic perps for traditional assets like XAU and SPX, appealing to traders seeking exposure to non-crypto markets.
- **Points Campaign**: The recently launched points program rewards active traders, potentially leading to a future token airdrop.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed by ex-Revolut team members, the platform emphasizes accessibility and ease of use.
- **Fee Discounts**: Using referral links (e.g.,[hhttps://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/DEFIPRIME](https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/join/DEFIPRIME)) provides a 10% discount on trading fees.

**Strengths**

- Access to TradFi markets differentiates it from crypto-only platforms like Hyperliquid.
- The points campaign offers early adopters a chance to earn rewards, potentially convertible to tokens.
- The team’s experience at Revolut suggests a focus on polished UX and regulatory compliance.

**Weaknesses**

- As a new platform, Extended Exchange is still in its early building phase, with limited liquidity and trading volume compared to Hyperliquid.
- Lack of detailed public information about its architecture, fees, or leverage limits makes it harder to evaluate fully.
- The platform’s TradFi focus may limit its appeal to crypto-native traders.

**Why Consider Extended Exchange**

Extended Exchange is a promising option for traders interested in TradFi assets within a DeFi framework. While it lacks the liquidity and maturity of Hyperliquid, its points campaign and experienced team make it worth exploring, especially for those looking to diversify their portfolios.

## Lighter: High-Frequency Trading Meets DeFi

![](/images/blog/perps/image3.png)

**Overview**

[Lighter](https://app.lighter.xyz/trade/ETH), built by Citadel high-frequency trading (HFT) alumni and backed by heavyweights like a16z and Dragonfly, is a private beta platform focused on institutional-grade trading. It emphasizes low-latency execution and zero fees for retail traders, positioning itself as a competitor to Hyperliquid for professional traders.

**Key Features**

- **HFT Expertise**: Lighter’s team brings experience from Citadel, ensuring a focus on high-speed trade execution and low latency.
- **Zero Fees for Retail**: Retail traders enjoy no trading fees, a significant cost advantage.
- **Private Beta**: Access is limited to invite-only users on a first-come, first-served basis, creating exclusivity.
- **Backers**: Support from a16z, Dragonfly, and other prominent VCs signals strong financial and technical backing.
- **zk-Proof Potential**: Lighter is exploring zero-knowledge proof technology to enhance throughput, potentially making it an institutional favorite.

**Strengths**

- Zero fees for retail traders make it highly attractive for cost-conscious users.
- The team’s HFT background ensures a focus on performance, appealing to professional traders.
- VC backing suggests robust development and potential for rapid growth.
- The private beta creates a sense of exclusivity and early adopter advantage.

**Weaknesses**

- Limited access due to the private beta restricts its user base and liquidity.
- Lack of public information about supported assets, leverage, or liquidity pools makes it harder to assess.
- Competition from Hyperliquid’s established liquidity and broader asset range may hinder adoption.

**Why Consider Lighter**

Lighter’s focus on high-frequency trading and zero fees makes it a compelling choice for professional traders. While it’s not yet publicly accessible, its Citadel pedigree and VC backing suggest it could become a major player. Early adopters with invites should explore its potential, especially if seeking a low-cost, high-performance platform.

## Ostium: Cross-Asset Perps for All Markets

![](/images/blog/perps/image2.png)

**Overview**

[Ostium](https://ostium.app/trade?from=SPX&to=USD&ref=X2I1V) is a decentralized perps platform on Arbitrum that stands out for its ability to trade real-world assets (RWAs) like forex, commodities, indices, and crypto. Backed by Pantera and Archetype, Ostium uses a pool-based model with a unique liquidity buffer to align incentives between traders and liquidity providers. Its points program and high leverage (up to 200x) have driven significant growth, with TVL rising from $5.5 million to $53.6 million.

**Key Features**

- **Cross-Asset Trading**: Ostium supports synthetic perps for crypto (BTC, ETH, SOL), forex (GBP, EUR, JPY), commodities (gold, silver, oil), and indices (S&P 500, Nasdaq), offering unparalleled diversification.
- **High Leverage**: Up to 100–200x leverage on RWAs, significantly higher than Hyperliquid’s 50x cap.
- **Liquidity Buffer**: Ostium’s two-tiered liquidity structure (liquidity buffer and market-making vault) minimizes the adversarial relationship between traders and LPs, offering a 28.69% APY on USDC deposits.
- **Oracle-Based Pricing**: Uses custom pull-based oracles for RWAs and Chainlink Data Streams for crypto, ensuring accurate pricing without tokenized collateral.
- **Points Program**: Launched in March 2025, the program rewards traders and OLP depositors, potentially leading to a future airdrop.
- **Low Fees**: Trading fees start at 2 basis points (0.02%), among the lowest in the industry.

**Strengths**

- Uniquely positioned to trade RWAs, appealing to traders interested in macro events and traditional markets.
- High leverage (up to 200x) caters to risk-tolerant traders seeking amplified returns.
- The liquidity buffer design reduces risks for LPs, making it attractive for passive investors.
- Strong backing from Pantera and Archetype ensures funding and development support.
- The points program incentivizes early adoption, with potential airdrop rewards.

**Weaknesses**

- Lower liquidity and trading volume (\$938 million weekly) compared to Hyperliquid’s billions daily.
- Some users report usability issues and high fees, though official sources claim low fees starting at 0.02%.
- Synthetic assets rely on oracles, introducing risks of pricing inaccuracies in low-liquidity markets.
- No central limit order book (CLOB) may lead to less efficient price discovery compared to Hyperliquid.

**Why Consider Ostium**

Ostium’s ability to trade RWAs alongside crypto makes it a unique platform for traders seeking diversified exposure. Its high leverage and low fees are attractive, but its lower liquidity and usability concerns suggest it’s still maturing. The points program offers an incentive for early adopters, making it a platform to watch.

- Ostium’s ability to trade forex without lot sizes or implied volatility issues has won praise from users.
- Lighter’s zero fees and trade execution are well-regarded, though Extended Exchange and Ostium face criticism for usability and fees.

**Which Platform Should You Choose?**

- **Hyperliquid**: Best for traders seeking high liquidity, a wide range of crypto assets, and a mature platform with a proven track record. Ideal for both retail and institutional traders.
- **Extended Exchange**: Suited for those interested in TradFi assets and early adopter rewards. Best for patient traders willing to navigate an early-stage platform.
- **Lighter**: Perfect for professional traders with access to the private beta, especially those prioritizing low latency and zero fees. Limited accessibility is a barrier for now.
- **Ostium**: Ideal for traders wanting exposure to RWAs alongside crypto, with high leverage and low fees. Best for risk-tolerant traders comfortable with a newer platform.

**Final Thoughts**

Hyperliquid remains the undisputed leader in decentralized perps trading, with unmatched liquidity, zero gas fees, and a robust ecosystem. However, Extended Exchange, Lighter, and Ostium offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Extended Exchange bridges TradFi and DeFi, Lighter targets HFT enthusiasts, and Ostium excels in cross-asset trading with high leverage. Each platform is at a different stage of development, and their points campaigns or airdrops could reward early adopters.

As the original sentiment suggests, trying these platforms and potentially selling their tokens to buy \$HYPE could be a savvy strategy. However, always conduct your own research, manage risks (especially with high leverage), and never invest more than you can afford to lose. The DeFi perps space is evolving rapidly, and these platforms are at the forefront of this exciting transformation.
