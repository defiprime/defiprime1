Welcome to the 4th issue of _The Defiprime Post_, a quick weekly primer covering the biggest developments around Ethereum and DeFi. This week’s issue covers events between August 9th and August 16th, 2020.

Want to mine some yield farming knowledge? We’re leaking alpha. Check out defiprime’s new [Alpha DeFi](https://alpha.defiprime.com/c/yield-farming/6) community forum, where we just launched some great guides on [YFI](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-yfi/93), [Loopring](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/liquidity-mining-on-loopring-exchange/100), and more.


## 🔥 The DeFi Bulletin

*   DeFi users went buzzing this week over the launch of [Yam Finance](https://medium.com/@yamfinance/yam-finance-d0ad577250c7), an unaudited project offering the YAM token and a yield farming campaign. Then the project rapidly imploded due to a [bug in its rebasing contract](https://medium.com/@peckshield/yam-incident-root-cause-analysis-f3fb2213af53). A YAM [migration plan](https://medium.com/@yamfinance/yam-migration-plan-dc72ad49aca6) is now in the works.
*   Lending protocol Aave now has the second-most assets under management, $1.05 billion, of any DeFi project. Aave also just introduced its [V2 upgrade](https://medium.com/aave/aave-v2-the-seamless-finance-d52075d97a70).
*   Ethereum’s top DeFi protocols have [impressive annualized earnings](https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1292953501257969664) as things stand: Uniswap (~$11.8 million), Balancer (~$11.4 million), Synthetix (~$6.3 million), Kyber Network (~$6.3  million), dYdX (~$5.5 million).
*   Opyn published its [post-mortem analysis](https://medium.com/opyn/opyn-eth-put-exploit-post-mortem-1a009e3347a8) on the recent oETH put exploit. The team, which just reimbursed its ETH put sellers, is currently working on fixing the vulnerability that led to the original exploit.
*   The bZx team published a new guide on [BZRX staking](https://bzx.network/blog/staking-bzrx), a pivotal aspect of the bZxDAO governance process.
*   Binance listed [yEarn’s YFI](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/a2e3970cd7334b659d426e547f7bcea0) , [Aragon’s ANT](https://www.binance.com/en/support/articles/c6b2142d75684540a64575f64fc1a55f), and [Curve’s CRV](https://twitter.com/binance/status/1294099728112603136) for trading.
*   Meet [PowerPool](https://medium.com/@powerpoolcvp/power-pool-a-solution-for-accumulating-governance-power-in-ethereum-based-protocols-92e8c88f655e): a new protocol for easily pooling governance tokens.
*   You thought the +100 gwei gas era was rough? Try [+200](https://twitter.com/defiprime/status/1293551140622053376)! Or [+300](https://twitter.com/BobTheJimbo/status/1293862246750314496)!
*   A new automated yield farming project, [APY.Finance](https://medium.com/apy-finance/introducing-apy-finance-afb263c1e504), entered into the limelight.
*   MolochDAO introduced its coming [v2x “Mystic” upgrade](https://medium.com/lexdaoism/introducing-moloch-dao-v2x-mystic-ethereum-contract-upgrades-c7984801d4db). The evolution will give members more features and cheaper transactions.
*   Hegic, the options trading protocol, announced the [HEGIC token](https://medium.com/hegic/announcing-hegic-token-liquidity-mining-utilization-rewards-and-staking-d1dd6605f2cd) and a liquidity mining campaign.
*   Idle, a lending protocol aggregator, has rolled out support for [multi-protocol yield farming](https://twitter.com/idlefinance/status/1294050710787633152).
*   Kyber Network published its [17th ecosystem report](https://blog.kyber.network/kyber-ecosystem-report-17-32d0d3a2557a) this week. July 2020 was the project’s 11th month in a row where it achieved a record number of total users, new users, and trade volume.
*   Smart contract wallet Argent is updating its gas policy and will no longer subsidize the gas of its users’ transactions. The project is exploring [L2 scaling solutions](https://www.argent.xyz/blog/gas-fair-use-policy-update/) in a bid to return to gas-free transactions.
*   ConsenSys dev Jordan Lyall spun up [The Degenerator](https://twitter.com/JordanLyall/status/1294466755692081152), a sarcastic build-your-own DeFi machine, and the project’s [actually taken off](https://twitter.com/decryptmedia/status/1294681022941011972) since then.
*   Ethereum brought in [$34.5 million in fees](https://twitter.com/lawmaster/status/1294511052382756865) last week compared to Bitcoin’s $9 million. Thanks DeFi!
*   Binance-backed decentralized perpetual contracts project Strike Protocol rebranded as [Perpetual Protocol](https://medium.com/@perpetualprotocol/strike-protocol-is-now-perpetual-protocol-5ceb4123ff4e).
*   Cream Finance revealed new info around the distribution of the project’s [CREAM token](https://medium.com/cream-finance/cream-token-and-protocol-plans-d44bed69710c), including multisig and vesting schedule plans.

On the heels of these launches, the stablecoin exchange became the 3rd DeFi project to hit [$1 billion](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/75014/curve-becomes-third-defi-protocol-to-hit-1-billion-in-total-value-locked) in assets under management.
