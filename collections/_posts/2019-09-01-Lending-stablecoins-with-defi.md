I've been advocating for DeFi for a long enough time and tested by myself most of the products presented at DeFiprime. But now I think it's the right time for skin in the game experiment.  

The idea is simple I had put $100 worth into various DeFi lending products, and going to track results over the year.  The goal is to increase my wealth in dollar values, and proof that DeFi is the thing and could be sustainable. How good could DeFi products be, comparing to a regular savings account? What would happen if one of the project's smart contracts get hacked? How DeFi lending rates changes over time? Let's figure this out.

For this experiment, I will skip fiat on-ramp hassle, and deposit 3.02 ETH(~$515 to cover gas fees) directly to the wallet [0xa51cE0796d32e3cc932C9a9e01663F68f71D9CBf](https://portfolio.defiprime.com/holdings/0xa51ce0796d32e3cc932c9a9e01663f68f71d9cbf), and then I'll exchange ETH to the stablecoins I needed at one of the DEXes.

Compound, Nuo, dYdX, and Fulcrum can be described as autonomous money markets. These platforms enable users to earn interest and borrow digital assets without relying on a counterparty. Digital exchanges commonly offer similar features but either the exchange or users need to provide liquidity to allow traders to borrow assets and trade on margin and users need traders to borrow funds to maintain an attractive interest rate. Idle Finance differs in that it aggregates lending protocols to allow users to automatically shift funds between protocols depending on which platform offers the best interest rate at the time.

DeFi products chosen in no particular order, and I don't take any extra precautions against smart contract hacks such as Nexus Mutual insurance. The reason for choosing USDC over DAI for NUO is that I don't want to put all of my eggs in one basket, also interesting to check a long time difference between DAI and USDC.

This experiment will help demonstrate the differences between lending protocols in DeFi and contribute to the development of a historical record that can be used for comparing investment opportunities in DeFi.

I'm going to update the results in this table each 1st day of the month, and provide screenshots from lending platforms dashboards to proof data.

### Update: October, 1, 2019

No surprises so far, no one was hacked, and money doesn't got disappear this month. DeFi rates have been in a range of 8-10% in September.

### Update: November, 1, 2019

DeFi rates have been in a range of 6-7% in October.

### Update: December, 1, 2019

November was a fascinating month for DeFi enthusiasts, due to MakerDAO's transition to multi collateral DAI, and conversion from SAI (Legacy single collateral DAI) to a new DAI. Most of the DeFi lending protocols published their own transitions plans. Moreover, Fulcrum and Compound already launched markets for the new DAI. I'm not going to migrate from SAI to DAI just yet, because APR for SAI is better at the moment:

Interesting that Fulcrum offers SAI to DAI migration right from UI:

### Update: January, 1, 2020

Lending APR for DAI has flipped SAI rates, so this month I'll convert SAI to DAI on Fulcrum and Compound. The dYdX already had converted SAI to DAI in a [centralized manner](https://twitter.com/dydxprotocol/status/1201589948266229765), so no extra steps from the user required.    

### Update: February, 1, 2020

Since data verifiable on-chain I decided to get rid of the "proof" screenshots on this page and simplify reporting in a table above. Worth mentioning that the only Idle is still in SAI at the moment, while others are already in DAI. Speaking of APR, looks like we are on a track to 10% APR by the end of this spring.

### Update: March, 1, 2020

Finally, someone got hacked! Fulcrum suffered from [two attacks in February](https://unchainedpodcast.com/how-2-defi-attacks-made-almost-1-million-in-profit/), happily, DAI lenders funds wasn't affected. But need to mention that after two hacks, users rushed to withdraw funds from Fulcrum pools, and thus bank run happens. If you want to get out of Fulcrum DAI lending pool, you need to look for available liquidity. Since I'm not going to pull off the money until the end of an experiment, I'll keep it in Fulcrum.    

### Update: April, 1, 2020

What a turn of events during March 2020! Crypto Industry's Black Thursday and issues with MakerDAO effectively wiped off APR from double-digit numbers down to 2-3% range. On a bright side, liquidity is back on Fulcrum and I can withdraw DAI any time if I want to.  

Next update is May, 1, 2020.
